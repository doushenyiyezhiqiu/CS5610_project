## Plan:
This is an individual project, so I am responsible for the whole project. I decide to divide the development process into three period, each period will have goals and results.

* v0.1: Design and Rout
    * A full stack web application (React + Flask + MySQL) where customer can browse and consume like other shopping websites.
    * Includes product-list, product-details, cart-details, checkout and order-history pages in the components/.
    * Set up relevant database and backend routers.

* v0.2: Prototype
    * Add login page using third party authorization Auth0.
    * Add login in status, customer who do not login cannot see order-history.

* v0.3: Final Project
    * A complete shopping website that custommer can browse, add items to cart and checkout.
    * Add local storage to cart details.
    * Make preparation in class.
    * Prepare relevant documents for grading and discussion in class.
