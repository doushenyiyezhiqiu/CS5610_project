To access the full features of this website, customers must first log in by clicking the 'login' button located at the top right of the navigation bar. Without logging in, customers are limited to browsing the product list without accessing detailed product information or using functions like 'add to cart' or 'order history'. To log in, a new page will open where new users need to register by providing an email and setting a password, or they can log in using a Google account. Returning users can simply log in with their existing email and password.

Once logged in, customers have full access to all product details and the complete navigation bar. They can search for products by typing in the search field at the center of the navigation bar and either pressing the 'enter' key or clicking the 'search' button. Products can be added to the cart, and the details can be viewed by clicking the 'cart' icon. On the cart details page, products can be added or removed. To proceed with the purchase, customers can click the 'checkout' button. During checkout, they will need to enter their first names, last names, emails, shipping and billing addresses, and select a payment method. It is important to use the same email address for order history tracking as used for logging in.
